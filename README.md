# SMD Challenge Extreme Edition

I competed in the soldering competition at the Hackaday Superconference last year which aims to see how fast you can solder up the [SMD Challenge kit from makersbox](https://www.tindie.com/products/makersbox/smd-challenge/). 
Dan Maloney did a [nice little writeup](https://hackaday.com/2019/11/18/a-newbie-takes-the-smd-challenge-at-supercon/) of the event and what it entails

The normal kit starts off at 1206 components and goes down to 0201, however SMD components have been getting smaller and smaller

I had the crazy idea to make something similar, but as small as possible

## Basic Components
- 555 Timer in dsBGA package (1.41x1.43mm)
- 74HC4017 decade counter in DHVQFN16 (2.5x3.5mm)
- All 01005 passives (400x200um)
- 0201 LEDs (350x650um) (pretty hard to find, so might to to 0402, but that seems too big!)
- Powered from a 3V Lithium CR1220 battery
- Board size defined by battery (18mm circle)
